# Unnecessary Vendor Prefixes in CSS

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug involving unnecessary vendor prefixes.  Unnecessary prefixes can lead to compatibility problems and bloated code.  The solution showcases how to correct this issue.

## Bug
The original CSS uses vendor prefixes where they are no longer needed (or are not needed at all). This can result in rendering issues on some browsers and is generally considered bad practice.

## Solution
The updated CSS removes the unnecessary prefixes resulting in cleaner, more efficient and compatible code.
